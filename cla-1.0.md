### Preface

This Agreement is between You, the Users, the Contributors, and Xibo Signage Ltd. The intent of the Agreement is to clarify your responsibilities as a Contributor.

The Agreement is meant to protect You, the Users, the Contributors,
and Xibo Signage Ltd from the malicious misdeeds of others.
The Agreement is *not* intended to restrict how You use Your own
Contributions.

The Agreement is written in plain English to be easily understood by
You and all those affected by it. The terms defined below and used
throughout this document are capitalized in order to reduce ambiguity,
but they should be understood to have their usual colloquial meaning
and the singular shall include the plural.

### Definitions

5. "Contribution" &mdash; Code, content, and ideas
   that are meant to be integrated into Projects. Issues (bug report)
   and pull requests (suggestions to integrate content) filed on a

   Contributors.

   Projects. Making use of a Project includes (but is not limited to)
   compiling and/or running its content, taking some action which
   causes its content to be used, copying its content, distributing
   its content, modifying its content, and even taking its content
   and/or ideas for a less direct purpose.


### Licensing Agreement

When You provide a Contribution to a Project:

* You assert that the Contribution was authored by You.

* You license that Contribution under the terms of the
  license of that Project. More specifically, You grant an irrevocable
  license for Your Contribution to the Users, the Contributors, and
  Xibo Signage Ltd.

* You assert that You have the authority and are able to license Your
  Contribution under the license of that Project.

* If Your employer has rights to intellectual property that You create
  which may include Your Contribution, then You assert that Your
  employer has granted You explicit permission to license the Contribution
  on behalf of Your employer.

Furthermore:

* You assert that You have the authority and are able to enter into this
  Agreement.

* If You become aware of a problem with any of Your Contributions or
  with the fact that You have signed this Agreement, then You agree to
  inform Xibo Signage Ltd about the problem, without any undue
  delay.
