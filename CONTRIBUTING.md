We'd love to work with you and accept your contributions. For small changes like bug fixes, typos, etc. Please Fork us and submit a pull request with the details of what you have changed.

For larger changes, you will have to electronically sign a Contributor Licence Agreement

## Sign the CLA
Signing the CLA is easy and hopefully painless.

1. Read the [CLA](cla-1.0.md).
2. Make an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) if you don't have one already.
3. File a pull request for this project.
4. Email us.
5. Wait for us to merge your pull request.

### 3. Filing the Pull Request
GitHub has [documentation to help you](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) file a pull request.

Your pull request should be the addition of a single file to the `contributors` folder. The name of the file should be your GitHub userid, with `.md` appended to the end. For example, the user `dasgarner` would create the file `dasgarner.md` in the `contributors` folder - this would result in the following full path: `contribitors/dasgarner.md`.

The file must contain the following:

```
[date]

I hereby agree to the terms of the Contributors License
Agreement, version 1.0, with MD5 checksum
e0de59b14f4c8a5d54ae9e75b182bd95.

I furthermore declare that I am authorized and able to make this
agreement and sign this declaration.

Signed,

[your name]
https://github.com/[your github userid]
```

Replace the bracketed text as follows:

* [date] with today's date, in the unambiguous numeric form YYYY-MM-DD.
* [your name] with your name.
* [your github userid] with your GitHub userid.

You can confirm the MD5 checksum of the CLA by running the md5 program over `cla-1.0.md`:

```
md5sum cla-1.0.md
MD5 (cla-1.0.md) = e0de59b14f4c8a5d54ae9e75b182bd95
```

If the output is different from above, do not sign the CLA and let us know.

### Sending the Email
Send an email to us at [info@xibo.org.uk](mailto:info@xibo.org.uk),
with the subject "CLA" and the following body:

```
